## Key Features ‚≠ê

- Data preprocessing using StandardScaler and RobustScaler
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection
- Handling imbalanced data using:
  - Random Undersampling
  - Random Oversampling
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- Cross-validation with StratifiedKFold
- Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV

## Models Implementation ü§ñ

The project implements six different machine learning models for fraud detection:

1. Logistic Regression
   - Basic implementation with default parameters
   - Tested with balanced and imbalanced datasets

2. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   - Using TensorFlow/Keras
   - Binary cross-entropy loss
   - Adam optimizer

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Tested with different values of k
   - Optimized for imbalanced data
   - Implemented with both under and over-sampling

4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Using both linear and non-linear kernels
   - Optimized with GridSearchCV
   - Tested with different sampling techniques

5. XGBoost
   - Optimized for imbalanced classification
   - High scalability and accuracy
   - Tested with under and over-sampling approaches

6. Random Forest
   - Ensemble learning method
   - Tested with balanced and imbalanced datasets
   - Optimized with different sampling techniques

Each model was evaluated using three different approaches:
- Original imbalanced dataset
- Random Under-Sampling
- Random Over-Sampling

## Model Evaluation üìä

Models are evaluated using multiple metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC AUC
- Confusion Matrix

Special emphasis is placed on recall and precision for fraud detection (class 1), as these are critical metrics for fraud detection systems.

## Installation üíª

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- xgboost
- imbalanced-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage üöÄ

1. Open `TrabajoFinal.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells to:
   - Load and preprocess data
   - Train models with different sampling techniques
   - Evaluate and compare model performance

## Results üìà

Detailed performance metrics and model comparisons can be found in `Comparar modelos.xlsx`. The evaluation focuses on:
- Model performance on imbalanced data
- Impact of different sampling techniques
- Trade-off between precision and recall
- Overall detection effectiveness
